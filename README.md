# CSE 12 Winter 2024 PA5 - Hash Table
This assignment focuses on leveraging Javaâ€™s built-in HashSet and HashMap to address practical problems without requiring the implementation of hashing algorithms or data structures. Students will be tasked with applying these data structures to efficiently manage and manipulate collections of data. Additionally, JUnit tests must be written to ensure the correctness of the implemented solutions, emphasizing the importance of testing in software development. Overall, the project aims to enhance understanding of hash-based data structures through practical application and testing.
